The history of chocolate begins in Mesoamerica. Fermented beverages made from chocolate date back to 1900 BC.
The Aztecs believed that cacao seeds were the gift of Quetzalcoatl, the god of wisdom, and the seeds once
had so much value that they were used as a form of currency. Originally prepared only as a drink, chocolate
was served as a bitter, frothy liquid, mixed with spices, wine, or corn puree. It was believed to have
aphrodisiac powers and to give the drinker strength. Today, such drinks are also known as "Chilate" and are
made by locals in the South of Mexico.

After its arrival to Europe in the sixteenth century, sugar was added to it and it became popular throughout
society, first among the ruling classes and then among the common people. In the 20th century, chocolate was
considered a staple, essential in the rations of United States soldiers at war.
The word "chocolate" comes from the Classical Nahuatl word chocolƒÅtl, and entered the English language from
Spanish.
