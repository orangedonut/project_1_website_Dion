     If you think you know chocolate’s role in the world, here are some facts that might surprise you.
</h1>
<p>
     Chocolate’s a wonder. Recently elevated to superfood status, the world’s favorite luxury foodstuff
     (making up half the candy sold in the U.S.) is so complicated and versatile that we’ve barely
     scratched its surface. It’s a dessert? Tell that to anyone who puts dark chocolate in their chili.
     It’s unhealthy? In moderation, it’s good for your heart, your skin and your brain.

<p>   Wrapping Bacon. I have to wonder how this dish originated, the same way I wonder how Cambodians
      discovered tarantulas are edible. No matter what it tastes like, the concept ranks alongside the
      Scottish deep-fried Mars Bar as a first-degree crime against food.
      - Fighting Tooth Decay. Say what? No, it’s true. An extract of cocoa has recently been found to
      be more effective than fluoride in keeping your teeth healthy.
      - Unsuccessfully Cornering Escaped Hamsters. For 9 days, Fudgie the Hamster evaded Scottish
      firefighters equipped with a sophisticated array of hamster-luring equipment included a tiny
      camera drizzled in chocolate – and the scrappy rebel was only captured when hunger drove him
      back out into the open. Even chocolate has its limits.
      - Keeping Your Ticker Healthy. Pick the dark chocolate and you have a dietary supplement that
      will improve your coronary circulation.
      Keeping Your Skin Happy. Cocoa butter is marvelous stuff – rich, smooth and with an aroma that
      will have everyone fighting to get near you. And since it’s chocolate, it’s technically edible
      – the way all skincare products should be.
      - Stop Your Tension Going Hyper. A study from the University Hospital of Cologne found a link between
      polyphenol-rich (dark) chocolate and lowered blood pressure. A heavenly reason to eat chocolate when you’re
      stressed – as long as it’s the right kind, of course.
      -Feeding Your Car (or Airship)? Escherichia coli bacteria have a sweet tooth – and when they gorge on surplus
      chocolate, they produce hydrogen that can be used as a clean source of power. Speculating wildly, could waste
      chocolate power the zero-emissions vehicle of tomorrow?
      -Making You Smarter. Dark chocolate is rich in flavanols that improve the circulation of blood around your body,
      including the brain – fighting mental fatigue, making you more alert and generally making you a more efficient thinker. For this reason, chocolate is one of the smartest foods we know.
